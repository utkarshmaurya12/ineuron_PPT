Proper weight initialization is important for achieving efficient and effective training. Here's an explanation of weight initialization and its significance:\n",

    "Importance of Initialization: Initialization sets the starting point for the optimization process during training.

Poor initialization can lead to slow convergence, vanishing/exploding gradients, or the network getting stuck in suboptimal solutions.\n",

In deep neural networks, gradients tend to diminish or amplify as they propagate through the layers.

Conversely, if the weights are too large, the gradients can explode, destabilizing the training process."
